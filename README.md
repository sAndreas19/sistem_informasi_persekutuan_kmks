## Overview
The KMKS Information System is a responsive web-based platform. KMKS (Kebaktian Muda/i Kampung Susuk) is a Christian student organization in Medan, where worship schedules, fellowship activities, and announcements were previously shared through social media groups. This approach often made information less effective due to repetitive greetings and posts being pushed down by new messages.
This project provides a centralized solution by integrating all essential information into a single platform that is easier to access, manage, and maintain.

## Features
📅 Worship Schedules – centralized and always accessible  
🤝 Fellowship Activities – organized event management  
🗓 Event Calendar – structured and easy-to-navigate schedule  
📖 Devotionals – accessible at any time  
🔐 User Authentication – secure login system  
🛠 Admin Dashboard – manage content and updates efficiently
